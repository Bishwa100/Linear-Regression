# High Profit Prediction using Linear Regression

Welcome to the README section of the High Profit Prediction project! This project focuses on using a linear regression machine learning model to predict high profit values. The project includes training the dataset using the mean square error (MSE) and gradient descent algorithm. 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast high profit values based on given input features. By leveraging the power of linear regression, we can analyze and predict profit outcomes, enabling businesses to make informed decisions and optimize their strategies.

## Features

- High profit prediction using linear regression
- Training dataset using mean square error (MSE)
- Implementation of the gradient descent algorithm
- Code built from scratch

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- pandas

## Usage

You can modify the dataset or tweak the hyperparameters in the `solution.ipynb` file to experiment with different scenarios and achieve better results. Feel free to explore the code and customize it according to your requirements.
